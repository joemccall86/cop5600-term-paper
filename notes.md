# Overview

Introduce Green Security Games, how they are an application of Artificial Intelligence Concepts. What concepts are applied? How is AI helping?

Focus on:

* Planning, learning in the Fang, Stone, Tambe paper
* Multi-agent systems and parameter learning in the Fang and Nguyen paper
* ML models and online learning in the Gholami et al paper.

Do not get hung up on Markov processes and models. I should be able to focus on the models being proposed, how they differ from the models in the other papers to solve the problem, and on the learning algorithms that are being discussed to learn the different models.

# Green Security Games: Apply Game Theory to Addressing Green Security Challenges

Provides an overview of the application of Stackelberg Security Games (SSGs) to Green Security domains.

Explains that there are unique differences to traditional security games, in that failure of the attacker is often lower cost, leading to more frequent attacks.
